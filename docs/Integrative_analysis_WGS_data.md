Integrative Analysis : WGS/NGS data
===========================================

*Datatypes: Whole Genome Sequencing data and expression data*

Scope
-----
- In this part R2 is used to provide information about how Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data can be viewed, shared and analyzed.
  This is a specialized topic for with most likely close collaboration is needed to tailor your own data to your needs.

## Step 1: View circos files.

1. To view circos plots of the sequenced genomes in R2, select *Static circos files (v3)* in Box 3 (Fig 1).
