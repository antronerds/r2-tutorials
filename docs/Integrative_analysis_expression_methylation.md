Integrative Analysis
===========================================

*Across platform: Methylation data and expression data*


Scope
-----

- Analyzing data with different datatypes this tutorial will focus on using methylation data and expression data.
- For some patients, R2 may have multiple types of measurements within the platform. Assumed  that you have access to more than one datatype (for public data, or when you are part of an r2 
- Tumor Neuroblastoma - Lavarino - 23 - rma_sketch - u219 and Tumor Neuroblastoma - Lavarino - 41 - custom - ilmnhm450 will be used for this tutorial.
- Find correlation between methylated sites within a gene and gene expression



Third subheader

Any text between restarts numbering

4.  Next list
  1. Two spaces create a sublist
  *  They can be mixed

Images are formatted as follows:

[**Figure 11: the extra settings Panel**](_static/images/OneGene_Adapting.png)

Note the enter between the lines; this is to guarantee proper formatting in pdf

The Did you know box is formatted as follows

---------
  ![](_static/images/R2d2_logo.png)**Did you know box**


> *Three or more minusses preceded by a return create a line; the > sign in front of a paragraph indents the whole paragraph and the single asterisks put it in italic*
