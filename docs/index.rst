R2 Tutorials: |version|
====================

Dear reader. Welcome to the tutorials for 'R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform'. The R2 platform is a (molecular) biologist friendly, web based genomics analysis and visualization application developed by Jan Koster and his team at the department of CEMM in the Amsterdam University Medical Centers (AUMC), location Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The idea behind the application is to enable researchers that are not experts in bioinformatics to mine omics data sources, and thereby gain insights for their research.
The tutorials have been assembled as guided short stories, that will instruct you how to get things done in the platform. We hope that, by following our examples, you will get familiar with the concepts of the platform, and thereby find your way in the platform. Even though many of our examples are illustrated by a neuroblastoma pediatric cancer dataset, R2 has many more (1700+) public datasets to work with (See also Selecting datasets). 

If you make use of our platform in manuscripts, then please add a citation that includes the following webcite: 'R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform (http://r2.amc.nl http://r2platform.com)'. This will help us get the necessary funds to keep on going and in addition allows us to 'scan' the literature to keep track of manuscripts that cite our resource.
