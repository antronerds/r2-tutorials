Integrative analysis: ChIP-Seq data
===================================

*ChIP data visualization can be combined with other types of data*

Scope
-----
-	Provides an introduction to the concepts and algorithms used in ChIP-Seq data
-	
-	Use experimental data to investigate the location of super enhancers on the genome


Given the advanced character of this type of data some introduction on the concepts and algorithms used is in place.
