Scope
-----

-   Working with datasets.
-   R2 allows you to perform all kinds of analyses based on a well annotated single dataset or a selection of datasets at the same time. Different analyses are available based on the selection of one of these options in field 1.
-   R2 contains mRNA gene expression profiles for more than 70.000 individual human samples. The samples are grouped in so called datasets. Each dataset has its own characteristics such tissue type, tumor type or from cell-line experiments.
-   The “**Tumor Neuroblastoma public - Versteeg - 88 - MAS5.0 - u133p2”** dataset will be used as an example dataset to guide you through most of the tutorial. Later on working with multiple datasets will be discussed.

Tutorial step 1
---------------

1.  In R2 a large amount of datasets are available for analysis and visualization. The numbered items in the main window will guide you through all the steps necessary to perform a task. In field **1** select “single dataset”, in field **2** choose “change
      

2.  A pull-down menu appears containing a large collection of datasets available for all types of analyses R2 is offering
3.  Click on the desired dataset.
      

Tutorial step 2
---------------

1.  Next to the pull down menu you can also choose for the “advanced dataset selection” tool. The advanced dataset selection facilitates searching through datasets using keywords and other filter options such as the minimal size of a dataset , the date a certain dataset was published etc. An example search would be finding all colon samples which are part of a mixed dataset consisting of normal tissue and tumor samples.
      

2.  Click on the “Advanced” link. A new screen shows a table where the headers can be filled with search entries to fine tune your search for a dataset meeting your search criteria. Enter ‘Neuro’ in the class column and’ 50’ in the ‘\#’ column and select ‘ greater than’ from the pull down menu. This returns all the datasets containing the search term ‘Neuro’ and having more than 50 samples.
      

3.  Clicking on ‘Neuroblastoma’ in the class 3 column containing 88 samples reveals a detailed info box containing additional dataset information from the R2 database. When the dataset is publicly availableclicking on the GEO ID link redirects to the GEO repository database where RAW data files are available. A Pubmed link is listed in case the dataset is linked to a publication listed in PubMed.
      
    Note: Clicking on an exclamation mark also shows detailed dataset information.

4.  Select “Across Datasets” in field **1**. Note that in field 2 different options become available compared to the “single dataset” option.
      

Analysis methods following selecting the “Across Datasets” option in field '''1 '''will be discussed in tutorial “Working with multiple datasets”.

Final remarks / future directions
---------------------------------

Some of these functionalities have been developed recently. If you run into any quirks or annoyances don't hesitate to contact r2 support (r2-support@amc.uva.nl).

We hope that this tutorial has been helpful,The R2 support team.
