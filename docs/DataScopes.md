DataScopes
===================



*Datascopes are typically landing web-pages that provide quick jumps to (dedicated) analyses and visualizations in R2. such datascopes are frequently associated with studies that share their data, presented from a manuscript in such a way that you can repeat their analyses, but with other selection criteria etc. Another type of datascope is the ability to limit data sets to a particular selection, such as a tumor entity.*



Scope
-----

-   Use data scopes to restrict data sets to a particular subject
-   Use data scopes as a landing page for a specific publication / subject





Step 1: Selecting a dataset restrictive DataScope
---------------

1.  DataScopes are represented in the left menu structure in R2 in the item named 'Change Data Scopes'.
Scopes can be grouped by different 'types' like 'paper' or 'tumor type'. Depending on your account access
more restricted scopes can be represented in your account. We will start by selecting a 'dataset'
restriction Scope by clicking on 'tumor' > 'neuroblastoma'. Alternatively you can click on the 'change data scopes' root item and get a tiled display of all the data scopes that you have access to with your account.
    
	![](_static/images/DataScope_select_a_datascope.png "Figure    1: Selecting a Data Scope.")
	
	[**Figure    1: Selecting a Data Scope.**](_static/images/DataScope_select_a_datascope.png)
	

2.  You may have noticed that the platform now includes 'neuroblastoma' in its title. Additionally, the number of samples available to you has greatly decreased. This is because you will now only be looking at datasets that we have annotated as neuroblastoma. This data scope can be useful if you only want to see datasets related to a specific entity that we have defined. If you want to select a new dataset, you will only be able to choose from neuroblastoma assets. In analyses such as '2D distribution', this restrictive data scope will also apply.
    
	![](_static/images/DataScope_resources.png "Figure    2: Neuroblastoma Data Scope.")
	
	[**Figure    2: This Data Scope restricts the resources to Neuroblastoma only.**](_static/images/DataScope_resources.png)
	

Step 2: Selecting a Data Scope with a landing page
---------------

1.  In the first example, the DataScope did nothing more than restrict the resourses at your disposal, which
can be handy for quick selections. A DataScope can become much more interesting if it has also got a 'landing page'
associated with it. In the next example, we will make use of a datascope that belongs to a manuscript on the analysis
of 500 whole genomes of medulloblastoma (Northcott et.al. Nature 2017). Select 'medulloblastoma 500' from the 'paper'
group in the Data Scopes menu.

2.	We can go to the 'landing page' for this data scope by either clicking on the button 'Goto Medulloblastoma 500 Home'
in Box 0, or click on the 'About Medulloblastoma 500' item near the end in the left menu.
	![](_static/images/DataScope_mb500_1.png "Figure    3: Landing Page for Medulloblastoma 500.")
	
	[**Figure    3: Landing Page for Medulloblastoma 500.**](_static/images/DataScope_mb500_1.png)
	
3.  Within a landing page 'tiles' are defined that will quickly bring you to specific analyses and or visualizations in R2.
These 'hotlinks' can be associated with advanced settings, and a such make the usage much easier. In the current Data Scope
you can eplore the genomics data for the 500 samples by investigating the annotation in the 'cohort overview', or check somatic
mutation status in the 'somatic variants' tile, etc. Most of these analyses can also be found / accessed via the main interface
while very specific ones may only be provided in the scope. Here the 'tSNE manuscript' would be an example of the latter. 

This chapter only serves to explain the basic usage of a data s cope. As you may realize, every scope can have many different options
and analyses associated with it, which goes beyond what we can document here. Just have a look at the available scopes once in a while
to discover what has been added, or make sure to follow our facebook page whare we make announcements on this as well.



Final remarks / future directions
---------------------------------


Some of the functionalities described in this tutorial have been developed recently. If you encounter any issues or difficulties, please do not hesitate to contact R2 support at r2-support@amsterdamumc.nl. Additionally, if you have ideas for new data scopes or would like to showcase your own data in a similar way, please feel free to get in touch with us through the same support address.


We hope that this tutorial has been helpful.
